Watching as I did, most of the back-story (which occurs in a futuristic 'socialist' world in which Earth is part of an enlightened galactic alliance) was lost on me but again the images were interesting (a mix of Soviet-style monumental architecture and neoclassical 'future-tropes'). The film is based on a novel by Ivan Yefremov and was originally intended to the first in a film series. Worth watching for the imagery but unless you speak Russian, I'd suggest investing in a DVD, waiting for a subtitled version to show up on-line, or skipping to the 'special effects' sequences.,\n",

Let's call this movie very, very acceptable...,\n",
            "The Shakespearean (\"The Tempest\") and Freudian (\"Id-monster\") elements have been noted by many critics. In the 1950's, with the atomic and hydrogen bombs so new and terrifying, other sci-fi movies had asked whether man had the wisdom to use all the new science for good rather than evil. But they usually dealt with that solely on a surface level, by just having some monster created with the new science that comes out and kills a bunch of people. Only \"Forbidden Planet\" dared to actually delve into the depths of human psychology to see what our baser instincts are capable of when given full rein. It directly refuted the notion that all that new science and technology was somehow civilizing humanity. The Krell, a far more advanced race than we, are never seen on screen (only their artifacts are shown, leaving you to imagine what they looked like). But their disappearance is a warning that even a far more advanced race like they, couldn't escape the baser instincts and subconscious drives\n"
